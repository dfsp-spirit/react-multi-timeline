## React MultiTimeline

A component that shows several (as many as you configure) horizontal timelines above each other. Useful for visualizing stuff that has happened at the same time in different places. Or whatever else you can come up with.


## WIP Warning

This is work in progress and NOT ready yet. You should not use it at this time. I will publish it to npm when it is ready. The process below describes only howto setup the development environment.

## Development setup

Make sure you have npm installed for your OS, add it to your path if needed. Then:

    cd react-multi-timeline/
    npm install

## Run development version

    cd react-multi-timeline/
    npm start
	
This should run it on 127.0.0.1:3000 and open your default browser at that location.


## Tests

    cd react-multi-timeline/
    CI=true npm test
